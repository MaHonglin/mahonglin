# Chapter1: Introduction

## 1.1 Supervised Learning

_**Starting point**_:

* Outcome measurement $$Y$$ \(also called dependent variable, response, target\).

* Vector of $$p$$ predictor measurements $$X$$ \(also called inputs, regressors, covariates, features, independent variables\).

* In the _**regression problem**_, $$Y$$ is quantitative \(e.g price, blood pressure\).

* In the_** classification problem**_, $$Y$$ takes values in a finite, unordered set \(survived/died, digit 0-9, cancer class of tissue sample\).

* We have training data$$(x_1,y_1),\cdots , (x_N,y_N)$$. These are observations \(examples, instances\) of these measurements.

On the basis of the training data we would like to:

* Accurately predict unseen test cases.

* Understand which inputs affect the outcome, and how.

* Assess the quality of our predictions and inferences.

## 1.2  Unsupervised Learning

* No outcome variable, just a set of predictors \(features\) measured on a set of samples.

* objective is more fuzzy — find groups of samples that behave similarly, find features that behave similarly, find linear combinations of features with the most variation.

* difficult to know how well your are doing.

* different from supervised learning, but can be useful as a pre-processing step for supervised learning.

## 1.3 Statistical Learining versus Machine Learning

* Machine learning arose as a subfield of Artificial Intelligence.

* Statistical learning arose as a subfield of Statistics.

* There is much _**overlap**_ — both fields focus on supervised and unsupervised problems:

  * Machine learning has a greater emphasis on _**large scale**_ applications and _**prediction accuracy**_.

  * Statistical learning emphasizes_** models **\_and their _**interpretability**_, and _**precision**_ and _**uncertainty**.

* But the distinction has become more and more blurred, and there is a great deal of “cross-fertilization”.

* Machine learning has the upper hand in _**Marketing!**_
